Here,I have built a custom environment using OpenAI gym.
The environment has all the necessary components like .reset(), .step(), .render(), .close() methods along with observation, actions, rewards, info and so on. 
The code is based on the readability such as a proper naming convention, doc strings, and comments wherever necessary. Stick to the PEP8 convention.Â 
The Agent, Hell-States, Goal are all images. Hence it must be imported to the same folder of the script.
