# PikachuEscape-v1
Built a custom environment using Python and Open AI’s Gymnasium library
The environment consists of an Agent, Hell states and a Goal state. It also has all the necessary components like .reset(), .step(), .render(), .close() methods along with observation, actions, rewards, info and so on. 
The code is based on the readability such as a proper naming convention, doc strings, and comments wherever necessary along with the PEP8 convention.
